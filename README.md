# Project Corndog

This is a pet project of mine that has been creating a microbot from mostly scratch.
He is also featured on season 17 of American Ninja Warrior.

I got the 3D files from [KDY0523](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) and a few other places:  
[Reinforced legs](https://github.com/mike4192/spotMicro) (Also has some other cool stuff including running it on ROS Kinetic)  
[My environment of MLagents](https://github.com/Obsideaock/Spot-Micro-Machine-Learning) (Still in progress)  
[BTULab at CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/btu-lab) (Helped with some printing)  

Printed my own Prusa i3 MK3S+ with PLA (mostly)

## Component List:
Rasbian on Raspberry Pi 5  
(FILLED IN LATER)  

Right now this is just the programming files, but I will soon add diagrams and images of how he was built and stuff.

Thanks!!
