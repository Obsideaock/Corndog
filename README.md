# Project Corndog

This is a pet project of mine that has been creating a microbot from mostly scratch.
He is also featured on season 17 of American Ninja Warrior.

I got the 3D files from KDY on Thingiverse and a few other places (link here)

Right now this is just the programming files, but I will soon add diagrams and images of how he was built and stuff.

Thanks!!
