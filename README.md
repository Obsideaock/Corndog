# Project Corndog

This is a pet project of mine that has been creating a microbot from mostly scratch.
He is also featured on season 17 of American Ninja Warrior.

I got the 3D files from KDY0523 (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283) and a few other places
Reinforced legs (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283)
Unity/ML Agents (My ML agents that trained it to walk: )
BTULab at CU Boulder

Printed my own Prusa i3 MK3S+ with PLA (mostly)

Running on Raspberry Pi 5

Right now this is just the programming files, but I will soon add diagrams and images of how he was built and stuff.

Thanks!!
